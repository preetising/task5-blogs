                Software engineers develop and create programs.
                However not everyone can become a software engineer. 
                To become a software engineer people should have 
                knowledge about the software engineering and education background.
            
            
                First of all, a Software engineering job is a fast growing job.
                At this time the world's technology is updated every time because 
                software engineers have many job opportunities

                Math and science are usually some of the more beneficial classes to take in college.
                A major in computer science is usually the best bet (¨Information¨). 
                A major in electrical engineering is usually okay too, but computer science is more applicable .

                These software engineers have to endure many struggles in the creation of their software,
                but the rewards from making a software make the struggle less painful. 
                The job of a software engineer is to work together with other engineers to 
                create a software (or should be product) that the company's customers will buy.


            
                This career is necessary because software created by software engineers makes 
                the lives of other people easier and provides people with high growth jobs. 
                Although software engineering involves long hours and great pressure,it gives 
                people the opportunity to solve problems and make products that others will 
                appreciate and use.Software engineering is a relatively new career but the 
                most important component of software engineering,the computer, has a long 
                history that started many centuries ago.
